# Intro to web development

# But first, what is the web?

<Notes>

* short for WWW (prefix for all websites)
* Part of the internet that you can interact with (websites, servers)
* when you interact with a fewsite eg uploading a photo, it sends a request to a server and the server caluclates the response. 
* servers It's like a computer (doesn't have a screen or keyboard) that runs on its own and responsible for responding to requests from the client. 
* the request and response goes through the internet
* the client (you) asks the server for information. The server returns the content to you

# The internet

<Notes>

* There are underwater cables (copper for old ones, or fibre optics for new ones) that connect the internet to different land masses
* fiber optics cables are glass wires that we fire light through and it's picked up on the optic sensors on the other side.
* There are also cables that go underground to connect different cites/towns etc
* whole world is connected by cables from machine to machine/ 
* sometimes satalites are used (more expensive and slower because they're further away without being connected)
* speed of internet can only go as fast as light. 
* europe to america in 0.15seconds (150 miliseconds)
