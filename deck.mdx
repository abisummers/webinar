# Hello, *world*!

# Intro to web development

---
# But first, what is the web?
* Part of the internet that you can interact with (websites, servers)
* servers --> It's like a computer that runs on its own
* the client (you) asks the server for information. The server returns the content to you

---
# The internet

* There are underwater cables that connect the internet to different land masses
* There are also cables that go across the land to connect different cites/towns etc
* sometimes satalites are used (more expensive and slower, longer distances without being connected)

 * sell products 
 * to communicate
 * watching dog videos

---
 
# And what do we mean by web development?

* making a website
* adding new features and improving exisiting features

# Key components of a website
* user friendly, easy to use, it does what it is meant to do
* accessible
* There are three main categories: content, design and interactivety. Every time you save something, or request new data, it goes to the server

---

# HTML
* Hypertext markup language
* markup --> structure of a page so that it's able to be transformed for users and for all computers
* but why? -> used to structure text and works across all browsers
* important to have web standards so things don't break

--- 

# CSS
* cascading style sheets
* the styling is passed down (order is important)
* it makes your website look good (colours, layout etc)
* it allows you to style it different depending on screen size
